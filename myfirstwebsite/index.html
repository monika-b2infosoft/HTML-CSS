	  Key components include a processor (CPU), RAM, storage (HDD or SSD), and a display. Battery life is crucial for users who work on the go. SSDs offer faster performance than traditional hard drives.
	  Laptops have built-in keyboards, touchpads, webcams, and Wi-Fi connectivity. Popular operating systems include Windows, macOS, and Linux.
	  Performance depends on the processor type (e.g., Intel i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen) and RAM capacity. Gaming and high-end laptops often feature dedicated graphics cards.
	  Regular updates and antivirus protection help keep laptops secure and efficient.
